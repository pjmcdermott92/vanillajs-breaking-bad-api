# Breaking Bad API Project

*Tech Used*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

###Project Scope

The purpose of this project was to build a web application that fetches data from a third-party API. The challenge was that the application had to be built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and that no frameworks or external libraries were to be used.

The API that was selected is the Breaking Bad API - which is a simple, fun API for Breaking Bad fanatics (like myself). The API has endpoints that allow users to get information about every character in the hit TV show Brekaing Bad, including their birthdate, date of death, occupation, and the seasons in which they appeared in the show.

Using this API data, the application displays all of the characters on the main page, allows users to get more information about specific characters by clicking on them, and allows users to filter the character by whether they are alive or dead, in alphabetical order, or in order of significance to the show.

The app manages state, has filtering functions, and allows for a live search.
